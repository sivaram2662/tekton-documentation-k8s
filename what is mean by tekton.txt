what is mean by tekton?

              1) Tekton is open-source-project which allows you too build cloud-native CI/CD systems on top kubernetes-native-resources for Building ,testing,deploying software.

              2) compared to other CI/CD solutions , Tekton runs natively on top of kubernetes. It makes use of custom resources definitions (CRDs) in order to register common CI/CD building blocks as a native kubernetes resources.

              3) It designed for creating and managing contineous integration(CI) and Contineous Delivery(CD) CI/CD cloud-native and containerized environment .
    
              4)  It Provides a set of resources and a framework for creating contineous integration(CI) and contineous delivery (CD) pipeline.
  

some key Features of Tekton :
=============================
  1) Pipeline as Code: 
                  
             --> Tekton allows  developers to defined CI/CD pipelines as code ,tipically  in the form of YMl manifsets.

             --> This make to Easy to version, review and maintain pipelines using familiar code managements practices.
 
  2) Integration-source-control:
   
             --> Tekton integrates with popular source control systems like Git, allowing you to trigger pipelines runs based on code changes.

  3) cloud-native compatibility:
             
             --> Tekton cloud native and compatible with cloud environments like AWS, Google cloud and Microsoft Azure ,as well as On-primes kubernetes clustes.


 4) Observability: 

            --> Tekton provides detailed logging and monitorning of pipelines runs making it easier to troubleshoot issues the status of your pipelines.


 5) community support :
 
            --> Tekton has an active and growing community of contributes , which means there is a wealth of resources documention and plugins available for users.

6)  Security: 
    
           --> Tekton allows yoy to implements RBAC(ROLE BASED ACCESS CONTROL) policies to control who can execute or modifiy pipelines and tasks. This helps ensure that your CI/CD process is secure.




Tekton components:
==================

1) Task:
    
     ---> Task is Fundamental unit of work in tekton. It represents a sprecific or operation in the pipeline, such as building a Docker image ,running test or deploying an application.

    ----> Task are defined as code and can be reused across different pipelines.

2) Taskrun:

    ---> A Taskrun represents the excution of a specific task within a pipeline. It capture the parametes , inputs and outputs for the task.

    ---> Taskrun are created for each task in a PipelineRun and are responsible for running the task in a kubernetes pod or container.


3) Pipeline:

    ---> A pipeline is a collection of one or more Tasks that are excuted in a specific order. pipeline define the workflow and dependencies B/W tasks.

    ---> Pipeline are also defined as code and are versioned , making to easy to manages and maintain complex CI/CD workflows.


4) pipelineRun:

    ---> A pipelinerun is an instance of a pipeline. it represents the excution of a pipeline with specific parameters and resources.

    ---> when a pipeline is triggered , a pipelinerun is created to manage the actual execution.


5) pipelineResources:

    ---> A pipelineResouces is a kubernetes resources that representes input and output resources for tasks within a pipeline. These resources include things source code, Docker images or configuration files.

    ---> PipelineResources enable data flow between tasks and stages in the pipeline.


6) Condition :
 
     ---> condition are used to control the flow of a pipeline based on the success or failure of a previous task or other conditions.

     ---> you can defined conditions to excute certain task only specific criteria are met.

 
Tekton has various extensions and integrations, such as Tekton Triggers, Tekton Dashboard, and Tekton CLI, which provide additional features and capabilities for advanced use cases.



Instalation process tekton :
============================

    1) You need a running Kubernetes cluster. If you're using a cloud provider like AWS, you should have a configured cluster.

    2) Make sure you have kubectl installed and configured to work with your Kubernetes cluster.
